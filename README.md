# React Webpack Boilerplate

A starting point for new projects. This boilerplate uses react, gulp and webpack
as a base.

## Usage

This boilerplte is still a work _in progress_ and not recommended for anything
beyond experimentation at this point.

### Installation

In the top level directory:

```
npm install
```

### Build

In the top level directory:

```
`npm bin`/gulp build
```

If you have gulp-cli installed globally, you do not need the npm bin path.

### Development

In the top level directory:

```
`npm bin`/gulp
```

This starts the webpack dev server on http://0.0.0.0:5000/.

### Testing

Tests are run by default during the build task.
